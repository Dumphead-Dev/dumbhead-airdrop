## üöÄ Airdrop Logic

- All tokens minted up front. Mint authority burned. Freeze authority disabled.
- No more tokens can ever be minted. No tricks. No admin privileges.
- Airdrop contract is public, transparent, and on-chain. You can read, verify, and suggest improvements.
- Distribution is **automated**‚Äîno manual lists, no behind-the-scenes actions.

## üß† Participation Requirements

- You must pass a math CAPTCHA in our Telegram bot and **provide a real Solana wallet address** (not just connect, you literally type it in).
- Your Solana wallet must hold **at least $10 in USDT equivalent (in SOL)**.  
  This requirement is to make it much harder for bots or farmers to participate, since they typically generate or recycle empty wallets.
- You **cannot change your wallet later**‚Äîchoose carefully.
- Only one wallet per device will be accepted.  
  (Note: Device and IP checks will be enforced. Using VPNs may not help.)

## üìä Referral & Multiplier System

- More real, verified referrals = bigger multiplier, up to a maximum of 20x.
- Your airdrop share depends only on your referral count, not your wallet balance.  
  Everyone who qualifies and participates gets a base share, multiplied by their referral score.
- **No one can claim until the threshold of 100,000 verified wallets is reached**.  
  This ensures the correct calculation of all shares.

## üéÅ Influencer Pool

- 5,000,000 tokens set aside for influencers‚Äîawarded directly to wallets that contribute most to the project‚Äôs reach and engagement.
  
## üó≥Ô∏è Community Governance

- The airdrop threshold (100,000 wallets) can only be increased by community vote, up to 200,000.
- Any future utility, CEX/DEX listings, or upgrades will also be decided by public votes.

## üí° Why $10 in SOL?

> The $10 minimum ensures that only real users join, not automated bots.  
> This makes farming much harder and preserves the value and fairness of the airdrop for genuine community members.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT

- If you provide a wrong wallet, you **cannot** update it or submit a new one later.  
  Each device and each human gets only one shot.
- No private keys or passwords are ever collected or asked for‚Äîever.

## ü§ù Contribute

- Read the code, suggest improvements, or open PRs if you spot bugs or want to improve transparency.
- All ideas welcome, but only serious suggestions make it into the contract.

*Built for the real DUMBHEADS. 97% to the people, no rug, no tricks. Just memes and math.*
